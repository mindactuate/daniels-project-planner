# Daniel's Project Planner

This is a small project planning tool to do some backward and forward planning.

## Find the tool here

Here is the link to the tool: [https://mindactuate.github.io/daniels-project-planner/](https://mindactuate.github.io/daniels-project-planner/)

## The cool thing

- you can create a project with multiple teams
- you can decide between forward and backward planning per team
- you can set relations between tasks
- you can set a project baseline ("original planning") per team
- you can track your project's progress per team
- you have a gantt diagram per team that can show the critical path and the original project baseline

And on top:

- this tool **doesn't store any of your data on remote servers** - it is just **working locally in your browser** and that's it!
- the caveat: you have to save your project as json file to your disk by yourself
- but: I implemented an auto-save function that stores a copy of your project.json in your browser cache (local storage)
